## What is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

### How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public?
- The host would need to be placed in a public subnet with a route to the iternet.
### What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part? 
- Some examples of public would be web servers and load balances and some example of private would be database servers and application servers. 
### What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure?
- Some tradeoffs of using a VPC are dependency on internet connection and data transfer cost. I think another large trade off is the learning curve, having to reteach people who are use to traditional infrastructure to VPC. 

#### Things I want to know more about:
- What is the main difference between a VPC and VPN besides cloud and network?

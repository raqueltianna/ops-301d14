## CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes

### What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
  - CIDR notation represents a CIDR block, which is a range of IP address. 
### How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
  - IPV4 address have four 8 -bit decimal numbers or octets.
### Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
- Setting binary aside, the range of numbers found in an octet ranges from 0 to 255
### What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
  - The final number after "/" represents how many bits make up the mask (a mask is referring to the subnet mask which is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into network and host portions).
### How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
  - There are 256 IP address in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24.

## What is Network Segmentation and Why it Matters? 

### In your own words, describe network segmentation.
  - Network segmentation divdes a network into smaller parts to do things like enhance security and manage traffic. 
### Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
  - I disagree. A well configured firewall is good but network segmentation adds an additional layer of defense like e
### What is a screened subnet?
  - A screened subnet lets users access the internet without explosing the LAN by establishing a network between an internal network and an external network like the internet. 
### Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
  - These are a few examples of physical security.

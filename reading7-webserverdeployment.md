## What is NGINX?

### What are some common use cases for NGINX?
- Some common use cases for NGINX are things like load balancer, which is where it distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. It also used as a reverse proxy, where it acts as an intermediary between clients and web servers for task that might slow down your web server like negotiating SSL/TLS 
### How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server?
- NGINX handle tasks that slow down the web server by implementing features like caching and load balancing. Like I mentioned above, it acts a reverse proxy which offloads certain taks from the web server, improving performance and seped overall. 
### Describe, as if to a non-technical friend how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might chooose to use it.
- NGINX is pronounced like "engine-ex". I think an organization might choose to use it because it can handle a lot of users at once and helps mitigate problems like managing traffic and security. 

#### Things I want to know more about 
- I think I am just overall interested in how NGINX works and what the interface of it looks like.

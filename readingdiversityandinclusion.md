## That Time When Stopped Coding 

### What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
- Around the same time that the percentage of women started to fall around the same time when personal computers started becoming more prevelant in households. 
### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
- It matters because it gave males a boost in their learning and career because at that point professors were assuming that their students had grown up playing with computers at home but that wasn't necessarily the case for the females. 

## Why Diversity Matters to your Tech Company

### When are diversity efforts most successful?
- When they are driven by a commitment from company leaders. 
### Why do diverse companies perform better?
- Diverse companies perform better because diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base. They also perform better due to a broad group of perspectives and idea which helps with increasing creativity. 
### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
- A diverse company could serve a diverse user base because they are more in touch. For example if a company that created a product that was marketed towards college age people (18-25) but the company only hired people that were well into their 40s. They wouldn't really know what people want outside of focus groups and trends but they can still be vague and trends are always changing so having a range of ages in their company could help get better insight into what the customers are really looking for.
